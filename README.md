<h1> Creating Instances on EC2 </h1>
An Instance is the same thing as creating a Virtual Machine on Azure. Instead of calling it a VM on AWS they call it Instance. <br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Mac Bookpro
- AWS Account

<h2> Steps to Create an EC2 Instance on AWS </h2>

- Step 1: I created a Free AWS account
  - note: that the free account allows you to create a free Instance for practice/testing purposes. 
- Step 2: create an Instance on EC 2
  - created 2 encripted keys
  - note: that you can create multiple instances at the same time. 
- Step 3: Connected to the Instance

<h2> Creating a Free AWS account </h2>

<p><h3> AWS account </h3> </p>
<p>
I went https://aws.amazon.com/free and created a free account. Once completed I observed menu options to get a understanding.

SSH (Secure Shell) sends a stead flow of encripted data to prevent other from being about to see what messeage is being sent across the network. (SSH also uses tcp.port == 22)

  You can use it to: 
  - remotely control another computer (like logging into a server from far away)
  - Run commands on it.
  - Transfer files securely.

DNS (Domain Name System) is kind of like a internet's phone book.

When you type a website like "google.com", the DNS turns the name into actual IP Address (ex: 142:255:190:14) in order for computers to use to find each other.
